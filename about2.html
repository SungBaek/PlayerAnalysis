                    It uses Riot Game's API to pull game data from a summoner's name and analyzes it to calculate win rate of the player
                    when a certain champion is on the same and when it is on the opposing team. The champion that has the highest win rate
                    when played with the player is called the angel and the champion that has the lowest win rate when played against the 
                    player is called the nemesis.

                    First, the application determines the unique userid based on the summoner name provided, then uses the id to make a
                    api request to access the data point called "match list" which gives a list of matchIDs, and the application uses
                    each of the matchID to pull from the data to get more detailed match data from Riot Game's API. Then the json object
                    is parsed and analyzed to determine outputs.

                    Outputs are then generated dynamically using data from DataDragon and DOM manipulation.

                    If you do not have a League of Legends account then you can test the application by typing
                    "Retribution12"
